"What would I tell 2011 me about working in startups?"


A company needs to have a solid, actionable mission statement.

Small teams with flat structures are best: they breed responsibility, communication does not become an issue. 

Teams work best with two things: alignment & autonomy.

To make decent products, you need more than just having passionate and capable people.

Process should never get in the way. There needs to be enough process to keep things organised, and no more. As simple as possible, but no simpler.

HRT.

Tight feedback loops. Same for worker reviews. In larger teams, anonymous peer review is great, as long as HRT is stuck to.

You can't change founders.

Startups are hard.

# Teams

Obviously this depends on the size on the company, but in a larger company

# Process

There are many people out there who talk the talk, but walking the walk requires a lot more effort. In terms of process, talking about making amazing products is very different to enabling a team to make those such products.

Whatever tools the team use to keep organised, they need to be as low-friction as possible. Ideally, the tools should be decided on by the team. Additionally, the process should be fluid, and should be improved upon whenever possible. If a team hates using a tool, it should be able to change it.

# Decision Making

Overall strategy should be decided on by the leaders of the company. Executing on that strategy however, should be at least in-part decided by the teams themselves.
