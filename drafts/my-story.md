Back in March 2012, an [old school friend](http://www.beyourbestpersonaltraining.co.uk/) asked me to build as website for the business he was part of. At the time, my only experience of building websites was moving images around in [iWeb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWeb) and animating stick men with (Macromedia) Flash... Suffice to say the website I built for him sucked pretty bad. *So* bad in fact, that I decided to roll up my sleeves, learn HTML and CSS, and rebuild it from scratch. Which I did.

I graduated in 2010 from Cardiff University with a degree in Biotechnology. Not wanting to do anything with it, I bummed around for a few years trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.

After making stick-death animations in Flash, and creating a couple crappy websites in iWeb, I bit the bullet and learnt about proper web design in the winter of 2011.

My first job in the industry was a UI/UX Designer at [Eysys](http://eysys.com)in June 2012. It was there that I learnt a lot about JavaScript, and caught the programming bug.

In March of 2014 I moved to London to join [Busuu](http://busuu.com) as a Front End Engineer. I resigned after (a tumultuous) 8 months, and I'm now building cool stuff at [Bizzby](http://bizzby.com).
