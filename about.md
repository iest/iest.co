**It's pronounced `yes-tin`, and is the Welsh form of *Justin*, in case you were wondering.**


About me
--------

I build stuff for the web using very modern tools (like react, webpack, babel etc. etc.). In my spare time I like to mix a cocktail, read a book, and play video games.

I grew up on a mountain farm in Wales (pictured above). Yes, there are sheep. We also have wind turbines.


About this site
---------------

The code for this site is all up on [github](https://github.com/iest/iest.co). It's typeset in [JAF Facit](http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit), served from [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/jaf-facitweb).

After playing around with building [my own blogging engine](https://github.com/iest/derp)(a terrible idea, btw), I now use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Pretty sure I'll be moving over to some kind of webpack/react thingy pretty soon.

It's all being served from a [Linode](https://www.linode.com) in London somewhere. I used a combination of [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to design and build the site.

If you have any questions, or comments, or you want to hurl some abuse; hit me up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_iest) or [drop me an email](mailto:hello_iest@me.com).
