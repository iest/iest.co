**I'm a designer and engineer working in London. I grew up on a mountain in Wales (pictured above).**


In case you were wondering, my name is pronounced **yes-tin**, and is the Welsh form of *Justin*.

After many years of playing with Macromedia Flash and Apple iWeb, I bit the bullet and learnt the basics of web design in the winter of 2011. During my first job in the industry at [Eysys](http://eysys.com) as a UI/UX Designer in June 2012, I learnt all about JavaScript. In March of 2014 I moved to London to join [Busuu](http://busuu.com) as a Front End Engineer. I resigned after (an interesting) 8 months, and I'm now building cool stuff at [Bizzby](http://bizzby.com).

In my spare time I play video games and faff over making coffee. Honestly though, this whole tech thing is my hobby too.

## This site

The code for this site is all up on [github](https://github.com/iest/iest.co). It's typeset in [JAF Facit](http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit), served from [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/jaf-facitweb). You might have noticed that all the text on this site is in one size. 

After playing around with building [my own blogging engine](https://github.com/iest/derp), I caved and now use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It's all being served from a [Linode](https://www.linode.com) in London somewhere. I used a combination of [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to design and build the site, over a few evenings and weekends.

If you have any questions, comments, or other wordly advice, either hit me up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_iest) or [drop me an email](mailto:hello@iest.co).
