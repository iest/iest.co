**It's pronounced `yes-tin`, and is the Welsh form of *Justin*, in case you were wondering.**


### About me

I'm a Senior Front-end Developer working with an awesome team at [Bizzby](http://www.bizzby.com). In my spare time I like to mix a cocktail and read a book.

I grew up on a hill farm in Wales (pictured above).


### About this site

The code for this site is all up on [github](https://github.com/iest/iest.co). It's typeset in [JAF Facit](http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit), served from [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/jaf-facitweb).

After playing around with building [my own blogging engine](https://github.com/iest/derp), I caved and now use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It's all being served from a [Linode](https://www.linode.com) in London somewhere. I used a combination of [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to design and build the site.

If you have any questions, comments, or other wordly advice, either hit me up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_iest) or [drop me an email](mailto:hello@iest.co).
