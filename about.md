## I’m a designer and engineer working at [Bizzby](http://bizzby.com) in London.

<small>It’s pronononced “yes-tin”, and is the Welsh form of "Justin", in case you were wondering :)</small>

### This site
The code for this site is all up on [github](https://github.com/iest/iestynwilliams.net).

Fonts are served by [Typekit](http://typekit.com/), with headings in Freight Sans Pro, and body text in Merriweather.

I made the initial designs in [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) over a weekend, then finalised and built the site with a few evenings (and weekends!) work.

It's hosted on [derpjs](https://github.com/iest/derp), a simple, markdown-based blog engine I built to scratch my own itch. It's all being served from a [Linode](https://www.linode.com) in London somewhere.

Every line of code was written with [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). On the site, I use [prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for syntax highlighting,  [some dumb code](http://codepen.io/iest/pen/mKpzA) I wrote to get the fancy sliding nav, and [molten leading](https://github.com/viljamis/Molten-Leading/) to optimise line-height at different viewport widths.
