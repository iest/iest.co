**I grew up on a mountain in Wales, but now I live and work in Foggy London Town, building products for [Bizzby](http://bizzby.com).** The scene above is where I grew up.

In case you were wondering, my name is pronounced **yes-tin**, and is the Welsh form of *Justin*.

After many years of playing with Macromedia Flash and Apple iWeb, I bit the bullet and learnt the basics of web design in the winter of 2011. During my first job in the industry at [Eysys](http://eysys.com) as a UI/UX Designer in June 2012, I learnt all about JavaScript. In March of 2014 I moved to London to join [Busuu](http://busuu.com) as a Front End Engineer. However, after I would call a [unique experience](#link-to-busuu-post), I'm now working with the awesome folks at [Bizzby](http://bizzby.com) building incredible products with bleeding-edge technologies.

I've always had a keen eye for design, but have never truly felt comfortable calling myself a designer. For one thing, what most people think design is isn't design at all â€” but on a personal level I'm quite self-critical, and design is quite a wishy-washy concept. There is no right or wrong like there is in pure engineering. There are shades of grey, and the best designs are worth more than the sum of their parts.

In my spare time I play video games and faff over making coffee. Honestly though, this whole tech thing is my hobby too.

## This site

The code for this site is all up on [github](https://github.com/iest/iest.co). It's typeset in [JAF Facit](http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit), served from [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/jaf-facitweb). You might have noticed that all the text on this site is in one size. 

After playing around with building [my own blogging engine](https://github.com/iest/derp) (and having crazy ideas for Dropbox integration...), I caved and now use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Because I keep the whole thing in my Dropbox, I can edit my posts from any device (but can only deploy from my Mac). It's all being served from a [Linode](https://www.linode.com) in London somewhere. I used a combination of [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to design and build the site, over a few evening's work.
