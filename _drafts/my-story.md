Back in March 2012, an [old school friend](http://www.beyourbestpersonaltraining.co.uk/) asked me to build as website for the business he was part of. At the time, my only experience of building websites was moving images around in [iWeb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWeb) and animating stick men with (Macromedia) Flash... Suffice to say the website I built for him sucked pretty bad. *So* bad in fact, that I decided to roll up my sleeves, learn HTML and CSS, and rebuild it from scratch. Which I did.
